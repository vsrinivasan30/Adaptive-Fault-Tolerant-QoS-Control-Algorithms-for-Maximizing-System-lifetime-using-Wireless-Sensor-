Adaptive-Fault-Tolerant-QoS-Control-Algorithms-for-Maximizing-System-lifetime-using-Wireless-Sensor-
====================================================================================================

Data sensing and retrieval in wireless sensor systems have a widespread application in areas such as security. The aim was to develop adaptive fault tolerant quality of service (QoS) control algorithms to deliver utilizing “source” and “path” redundancy.1.	To applying redundancy to satisfy application specified reliability and timeliness requirements for query-based WSNs. 2.	We develop the notion of “path” and “source” level redundancy 3.	Lifetime of the system is maximized. 4.	Timeliness, Multiple data delivery speed options. 5.	Reliability, Multi-path forwarding.
